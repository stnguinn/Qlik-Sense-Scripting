NPrinting needs to reload metadata from Qlik Sense apps to generate reports. If Section Access is applied, there are a few points to consider:

    Service Account Permissions: Ensure that the service account used by NPrinting has the necessary permissions in Section Access. This account needs access rights similar to those of an admin or a user with complete access to the app data.

    Section Access Script: Verify that the Section Access script in Qlik Sense is correctly configured. It should include the NPrinting service account with appropriate access levels.

    Data Reduction: If Section Access reduces data for the NPrinting service account, it may not be able to see all the necessary data, leading to metadata reload errors.

    Connection Configuration: In NPrinting, when setting up the connection to a Qlik Sense app with Section Access, you must specify credentials that have the necessary access in the Section Access setup of the Qlik Sense app.

    Latest Versions: Ensure both Qlik Sense and NPrinting are updated to their latest versions, as there could be bug fixes or improvements related to Section Access handling.

    Logging and Error Messages: Check NPrinting and Qlik Sense logs for any specific error messages that occur during the metadata reload. These messages can provide more insight into the nature of the problem.

    Testing Without Section Access: As a troubleshooting step, try reloading metadata without Section Access applied to confirm if the issue is directly related to Section Access.
